## Welcome to Microsoft AZ-305 Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions

#### **INFO**
- This repo contains the custom labs for AZ-305 Online delivery

- This year (2022) , Microsoft have decided to consolidate AZ-303(Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect) and AZ-304(Microsoft Azure Architect Design) training into AZ-305 (Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions), unfortunately, Microsoft decided to remove all Hand-On Labs on AZ-305 and replace it with Case Studies. With Online delivery, we cannot simulate exact classroom method which consist of Demonstration, Group Discussion, Observation of Running systems and performing Case Study, therefore I've gathered Labs from various other AZ Titles so that you the student can have some level of Hands-On Practice.

- The labs in this repo have subset labs from the following AZ training:
    1. AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
    1. DP-900 Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals
    1. DP-300 Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure
    1. AZ-301 Microsoft Azure Architect Design ( Old )
    1. AZ-304 Microsoft Azure Architect Design ( New )
    1. AZ-303 Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies
    1. AZ-204 Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure
    1. AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator
    1. AZ-500 Azure Security Technologies

#### **REQUIREMENTS**
- To use all the labs in this repo, you need the following Software / Hardware :
    1. Azure Pass Code ( will be given when you attend official MOC )
    1. Azure Portal Access ( enabled with Azure Pass )
    1. A workstation with above 3Mbps bandwidth Internet Connection
    1. Disable any VPN connection on your workstation , as this may degrade connection to Azure Pass based Azure Portal

- You may Clone this repo to your Workstation , you can download and install GitHub Desktop and use GitHub Desktop to clone this entire repo, Lab instruction may ask you to upload lab files from your Workstation to Azure Cloud Shell, so, having a copy of this repo on your workstation is an added advantage.

- If you are using a non Administrator Privileged Workstation, you may not able to install required softwares, in this case, it is recommended to use Azure Cloud Shell ( you can clone this in Azure Cloud Shell )

#### **WARNING**
- Given the **dynamic** nature of Microsoft Azure cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up, so don't make a big fuss about that, just try to search in the new UI for similar objective.

- Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. If this occurs, **adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed**.

- This hub will go private on **8pm 21st of January 2022**

#### **END-INFO** 
- Thank You and Good Luck with the labs
- Cheers
